Why learn assembly? Because it lets you pump every last ounce of performance out of hardware.

I'm using [this book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KKL8VXQ?ref=KC_GS_GB_US) as my guide.

### One more thing.
Before you try to build anything, make sure `$PICO_SDK_PATH` is set to a valid Pico C/C++ SDK directory!

I've included a simple script, `setup.sh`, that simply clones the SDK repo, initializes *all* submodules, and builds it with all available CPU cores.
